A simple plugin that generates fluent interface property access method for IntelliJ IDEA.

Search in IDEA plugins manager for 'generate.fluent.interface' to install, while the plugin jar file can also be found at project downloads.

I'm eager to make this plugin better, feature requests and bug reports are very welcomed.

If any further help is needed, feel free to email me.
